# Portfolio

Hi there, and welcome to my portfolio!

I’m a data science enthusiast just starting out in this exciting field. My goal is to grow professionally, and I’ll be sharing projects related to systems, technologies, and other standalone projects I’m working on or that come my way.

I have a particular interest in computer vision, so I’ll also be posting links and resources on LinkedIn that have been especially helpful for my learning. Please note that some of the content here will be in English, but there will also be content in Spanish.

I hope you find this material useful, and I’d appreciate any feedback or corrections if you notice anything that could be improved.

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my projects!
